# SupperTime

SupperTime is an application developed to help with meal prepping. Through SupperTime, you can search recipes and save them to a weekly queue which creates a custom shopping list for you! Once you’ve picked up the items from your shopping list, you can then add them to your pantry for use in future recipes.
